# Hey!
Welcome to the official Midelpic github account.

Here, you'll find the code for our sites, like [The main site](https://site.midelpic.repl.co) and [the media site](https://media0.midelpic.repl.co).

If you dont know, Midelpic is a site made by me and my friends to find out if it is possible to make an alternative to discord. As a fun project, obviously. And though it might sound easy, it is not. Hence:

Midelpic is looking for **talented HTML, JS and Python** coders who are **bored**, or want to help us make this **dream come true**. Of course, as this is **just** a fun project (*which* ***might*** *become a real site one day*), you will **not be paid** to help. And to clear up any confusion, you don't **NEED** to help. If you just want to **look** at the progress or something else, **you are welcome** here anyway.
